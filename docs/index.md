# Intro


## Genral terms
- Diagram - using a key (standard seen bellow) there will be a diagram below, there will also be a perspective reference such as "Birds-Eye"
- B = Bomb
- N = Normal block, could be a 1x1 or bigger
- I = indestructible block, could be 1x1 or bigger
- x = Exploaded block


## Methods of gates

- ### [Explosive (Yellow) Bombs](#explosive-bombs)
Explosive bombs will break any blocks in a five block radius, which can detonate another bomb, creating a chain. You can find explosion bomb gates [here](bomb-gates)

- ### [Players](#players)
Using players we can throw them around, using pearls, launch pads, and exploding them precisely. You can find player gates here [MAKE PLAYER GATE PAGE]

- ### [Icicles](#icicles)
Icicles can trigger bombs, or other icicles from any distance by running into them. By chaining icicles and/or bombs together we can create a wire/chain. You can find the icicle gates [here](icicle-gates)

## Explosive Bombs
Using yellow bombs we can chain them together to make wiring.
Each bombs has a radius of 5, So looking at this diagram we can se how far a bomb may reach:

## Players
Using players we can throw them around, using pearls, launch pads, and exploding them precisely. You can find player gates here [MAKE PLAYER GATE PAGE]

## Icicles
Icicles can do various different things, such as triggering bombs of any type, triggering other icicles, destroying blocks, etc. Icicles are also very fast, making them ideal for larger circuits. However, icicles regenerate, and can be triggered several times, which can mess up gates and different areas of the circuits. To mitigate this, you can have an icicle trigger a bomb, which will trigger an adjacent icicle to continue the circuit (make sure to place indestructible blocks to prevent runaway icicles after the bomb is gone).
