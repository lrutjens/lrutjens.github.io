Do to the way everything is setup and how explosion chains works, we can't just start an explosion chain if we don't get an input, which is what a NOT gate is supposed to do. To make them work, we must have a second explosion chain, which acts as a \"timer/equals buttom\", go and \"check\" if each NOT gate has recieved an input.
